Pretty Scheduler Readme

This is a Preemptive Scheduler I created for an assignment in my Operating Systems course. 
(Professor said points for pretty, hence the "art" in main)

* Main reads in input file and passes to chosen scheduler object, in regular or debug mode,
* which schedules the processes into a Gantt chart, such as described here 
* https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html
*
* input file --> [Main] --> List of [Process] --> [Scheduling algorithm]
*
* Java 8 lambdas are used for this set of schedulers.
*
* Scheduler manages queues (array lists) for access to CPU and IO based 
* on the method chosen by the user. The collection of processes on the queues 
* are sorted using comparators so that the desired process is located at index 0 of the queue.
* The ID of this process is then printed as a string in the CPU or IO array 
* and the process removed from queue.
*

Format of input file:

The expected text file will have the number of processes, followed by a separate line
with 4 integers with information about each process:
arrival time on queue, priority level, process time, number of CPU bursts (int)

Each process is assigned an ID (character) and its info stored as a Process record.
